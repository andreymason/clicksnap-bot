# Clickasnap Photo Liker

This Python script automates engagement on Clickasnap, a platform for sharing photos. It logs into a Clickasnap account, browses the feed for new photos, and likes them to attract attention from other users.

## Features
- **Login Automation**: The script automatically logs into the Clickasnap account using provided credentials.
- **Engagement**: It browses the feed for new photos and likes them to increase visibility and attract more users to the account.

## Usage
1. **Installation**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. **Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies by installing from the requirements file:
   
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configuration**: Replace placeholders in the script with your actual Clickasnap account credentials (`USERNAME`, `EMAIL`, `PASSWORD`).
4. **Cron Job**: Set up a cron job to run the script periodically. For example, to run the script every 15 minutes, add the following line to your crontab:

   ```
   */15 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/script.py >/dev/null 2>&1
   ```

   Replace `/usr/bin/python3` with the path to your Python interpreter, and `/path/to/your/script.py` with the actual path to your script.

## Script Details
- The script first logs into the Clickasnap account using provided credentials.
- It then fetches new photos from the feed and likes them one by one.
- The script is designed to run periodically (e.g., every 15 minutes) to ensure consistent engagement with new content.

Enjoy automating engagement on Clickasnap!
